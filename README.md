## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

This was my first time using Tailwind CSS and I really enjoyed it! I found it a lot easier to customize and achieve the desired outcome than Bootstrap. It feels odd to me to be putting so many classes in HTML as opposed to having a separate stylesheet and keeping my HTML clean, so that will take a bit of getting used to. Tailwind is very intuitive though and I can see it making me much more fast and efficient than by styling my websites with vanilla CSS, once I get the hang of it and have most of the classes memorized (which shouldn't take too long). I look forward to creating more projects with this framework!

One of the problems I always run into with projects is when the image has a colored overlay. It took me a couple of tried to get this one looking right, but I think it's pretty close. I initially did a colored background behind the image and adjusted the opacity of the image itself, but didn't like the way that looked because the image didn't look as crisp. I changed it up and added an overlay div with absolute positioning and made that transparent to cover the image. I also added a few hover classes just for fun because they're so easy to do with Tailwind.

### Continued development

I look forward to continuing to use Tailwind CSS. I'm also excited to start diving into JavaScript again after almost a year without using it. Previously, I had started Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course, (The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert)[https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/] and I got through objects and onto data structures, modern operators, and strings before life got in the way and I put coding on the back burner. After my wedding and honeymoon over the next couple of weeks I plan to go through the course again and use freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project to dive headfirst into JavaScript and related frameworks and get ready to change careers into web development.
